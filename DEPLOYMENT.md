# Deployment Configuration Fix

## Issue
The deployment failed because of a configuration mismatch:
- Vite builds to `dist/public` directory
- Replit deployment expects files in `dist` directory

## Solution
Since the core configuration files (vite.config.ts and .replit) cannot be modified, I've created scripts to fix the deployment mismatch by copying files from the build output location to where deployment expects them.

## Available Fix Scripts

### Option 1: Node.js Script (Recommended)
```bash
node scripts/deploy-fix.js
```

### Option 2: Bash Script
```bash
./scripts/deploy-fix.sh
```

## Deployment Process

1. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Run the deployment fix:**
   ```bash
   node scripts/deploy-fix.js
   ```

3. **Deploy via Replit:**
   - Click the Deploy button in Replit
   - The files will now be in the correct location for static deployment

## What the Scripts Do

1. Check if `dist/public` directory exists (build output)
2. Create `dist` directory if it doesn't exist
3. Copy all files from `dist/public` to `dist`
4. Provide success/error feedback

## Automation Options

If you want to automate this process, you can:

1. Run the fix script after every build manually
2. Create a custom deployment workflow that includes the fix script

## Technical Details

- **Build Output Location:** `dist/public` (configured in vite.config.ts)
- **Deployment Expected Location:** `dist` (configured in .replit)
- **Fix:** Copy files from build output to deployment expected location

This solution preserves the existing build configuration while ensuring deployment compatibility.
